# Project Documentation: Scientific RAG System

## Project Overview
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system using LangChain, designed to answer user questions based on provided scientific articles. The system is divided into two main components:

1. **Jupyter Notebook Backend**: Contains the core RAG implementation with these key features:
   - Document loading and processing
   - Text embedding and vector storage
   - Question answering chain setup
   - API endpoints for frontend communication

2. **ReactJS Frontend**: A user interface that:
   - Allows users to input questions
   - Displays answers from the RAG system
   - Shows relevant source documents
   - Provides a clean, interactive experience

The system works by processing scientific articles into a searchable knowledge base, then using AI to generate accurate answers based on both the stored knowledge and its general training.

## Jupyter Notebook Backend Implementation

### Step 1: Environment Setup and Imports
We begin by importing all necessary Python libraries and setting up the environment. This includes:

1. **LangChain components**: For building the RAG pipeline (document loaders, text splitters, embeddings, etc.)
2. **FAISS**: For efficient vector similarity search
3. **OpenAI**: For accessing language models
4. **FastAPI**: For creating web API endpoints
5. **Utility libraries**: For environment variables, OS operations, and async support

This setup ensures we have all tools needed for document processing, AI capabilities, and web service functionality before proceeding to the core implementation.

Key preparations:
- Loading environment variables (like API keys)
- Configuring the execution environment
- Importing specific functions from each library
- Setting up global configurations

The imports are organized by functionality (document processing, AI models, vector storage, etc.) for better maintainability.

### Step 2: Document Loading and Initial Verification

This step focuses on loading the raw text documents and performing initial quality checks:

1. **Document Loading Process**:
   - Executes the DirectoryLoader to scan and load files
   - Processes all matching .txt files recursively in the 'articles' folder
   - Converts each text file into a LangChain Document object
   - Includes metadata about each document's source

2. **Loading Feedback**:
   - Progress bar shows real-time loading status
   - Visual indication of how many files are being processed
   - Immediate feedback if no files are found

3. **Verification Checks**:
   - Document count verification ensures files were found
   - Character count confirms successful content loading
   - Sample preview validates text extraction quality

4. **Error Prevention**:
   - Checks for empty documents
   - Verifies text encoding is handled properly
   - Confirms basic document structure

Key Characteristics:
- Handles multiple documents in batch
- Preserves original file structure
- Provides immediate validation feedback
- Prepares data for downstream processing

### Step 3: Document Chunking with RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter

This step processes the loaded documents by splitting them into smaller, more manageable chunks:

1. **Text Splitter Configuration**:
   - Uses recursive splitting algorithm that preserves logical text structure
   - First attempts to split on paragraph breaks (newlines)
   - Then tries sentence boundaries if needed
   - Finally splits on words if required to reach target size

2. **Chunk Size Optimization**:
   - 1000 characters provides balance between context and processing efficiency
   - Suitable size for most embedding models' input limits
   - Large enough to contain complete thoughts/sections

3. **Context Preservation**:
   - 200-character overlap maintains continuity between chunks
   - Prevents loss of meaning at split points
   - Helps the RAG system understand relationships between sections

4. **Metadata Tracking**:
   - `start_index` records each chunk's original position
   - Enables tracing answers back to source locations
   - Maintains document provenance information

5. **Output Verification**:
   - Prints total chunks created for quality control
   - Implicitly validates the splitting worked as expected
   - Provides metrics for tuning chunk sizes if needed

Key Benefits:
- Enables efficient processing of long documents
- Maintains semantic coherence within chunks
- Preserves document structure and context
- Supports accurate source attribution

### Step 4: Vector Embedding and Storage Setup

This step transforms the text chunks into numerical representations and stores them for efficient retrieval:

1. **Environment Configuration**:
   - Loads sensitive credentials securely from .env file
   - Validates presence of required MistralAI API key
   - Handles optional Hugging Face token with fallback logic
   - Provides clear warning messages for missing credentials

2. **Embedding Initialization**:
   - Uses MistralAI's "mistral-embed" model specifically designed for embeddings
   - Converts text chunks into high-dimensional vectors (typically 1024-4096 dimensions)
   - Maintains semantic relationships between text in vector space

3. **Vector Storage with FAISS**:
   - Creates optimized index structure for fast similarity search
   - Stores both vectors and original text chunks
   - Enables efficient nearest-neighbor searches
   - Handles large document collections with low memory overhead

4. **Verification Process**:
   - Confirms successful document ingestion
   - Validates vector store integrity
   - Provides visibility into storage operation results

Key Features:
- Secure credential management
- State-of-the-art embedding quality
- Optimized search performance
- Scalable storage architecture
- Built-in verification checks

Implementation Notes:
- FAISS automatically normalizes vectors
- Embedding model handles tokenization internally
- Vector store maintains original document metadata
- Entire process is batch-oriented for efficiency
  
### Step 5: RAG Workflow Construction

This step establishes the complete question-answering pipeline by connecting all components:

1. **State Management**:
   - Defines a structured workflow state containing:
     - Original user question
     - Retrieved context documents
     - Final generated answer
   - Uses type hints for better code reliability
   - Maintains data consistency throughout the pipeline

2. **Retrieval Component**:
   - Performs similarity search against vector store
   - Returns top relevant documents for the question
   - Preserves document metadata for attribution

   - Enforces comprehensive source attribution:
     - Document names
     - Paragraph indexes
     - Line number ranges
   - Uses specialized prompt engineering to:
     - Prevent hallucination
     - Ensure answer completeness
     - Maintain consistent formatting

4. **Prompt Engineering**:
   - Detailed template enforces:
     - Source-exclusive answers
     - Structured output format
     - Complete provenance tracking
   - Includes fallback for missing information
   - Mandates clear section organization

5. **Workflow Orchestration**:
   - Creates directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure
   - Defines explicit execution sequence:
     1. Question input
     2. Document retrieval
     3. Answer generation
   - Provides compilation for execution

Key Features:
